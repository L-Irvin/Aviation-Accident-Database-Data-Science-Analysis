# Aviation Accident Database: Data Science Analysis

This is a group assignment of NTU CZ1015: Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, by Lab Group FSP3 Team 6.

In this project, we are encouraged to create a model which optimizes the prediction of aircraft accident severity.

There are 3 files in this repository:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning all the dirty data from the raw data.
1. **Bivariate Analyses**: Comparison between variables to determine the decisive factor of an accident.
1. **Classifier Algorithms**: Harnessing several machine learning algorithms to find the best predictor of an accident's severity.

## Dependencies

- `Python`
- `Pandas`
- `NumPy`
- `Seaborn`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Geopandas`
- `sklearn`
- `scipy`
- `graphviz`
- `pydot`
- `xgboost`
- `keras`

## Setup

1. Make sure Jupyter Notebook is already installed. We may do so by installing `Anaconda` or `Jupyter`.
1. Install all the required dependencies. _We may also create a virtual environment for this purpose_.
1. Make sure `AviationData` file is in the same working directory as the Jupyter Notebook files.
1. Run the files, starting from Data Cleaning, Bivariate Analyses, and Classifier Algorithms.
